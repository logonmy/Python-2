In MLGFIM, the problem domain is first divided into multilevel cubes. Next, the peer-level Green\'s function interpolation technique is employed, and then, a new lower-to-upper-level Green\'s function interpolation technique is devised. They are used with the multilevel dis-cretization to speed up the matrix-vector multiplications in the iterative solution in which a computational complexity of O(N) is achieved. The MLGFIM is used to extract the capacitances encountered in radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) and microelectromechanical systems. Moreover, to demonstrate its efficiency both in simulation speed and memory storage requirement, MLGFIM is compared with FastCap for free space problems and applied to extract capacitances from multilayered structures. For problems with 375000 unknowns, the proposed method only requires 343 MB of computer memory. © 2005 IEEE.','-1','Green's function',' Computational complexity -  Computer simulation -  Electrostatics -  Frequencies -  Integral equations -  Integrated circuits -  Interpolation -  Microelectromechanical devices -  Problem solving',' Electrostatic problems -  Memory storage -  Multilevel Green\'s function interpolation method (MGFIM) -  RFIC','921.2Calculus - 921Mathematics - 723.5Computer Applications - 723.4Artificial Intelligence - 921.6Numerical Methods - 721.1Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 711.1Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 701.1Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 601.1Mechanical Devices - 714.2Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits','10.1109/TCAD.2005.850804','Compendex','','','','','','Wang, H.G.;','hgwang@zju.edu.cn;');
